# Degree-of-Separation-C++

2 random person. A link is made between 2 users based on their friendship or by being located within the 
same geographical location. For instance, if Rose Gallenger is a close contact of Holly Green, and 
Holly Green is a close contact of Ojay Donaldson, and Ojay Donaldson is a close contact of Gina Kingston, 
then there are three (3) degrees of separation between Rose Gallenger and Gina Kingston. In relation 
to geographical llocations, two users are said to be from the same  location if they both share one 
of all of the following: school, work or community.

It allows you to perfrom all CRUD operations in relation to a user in the network.
