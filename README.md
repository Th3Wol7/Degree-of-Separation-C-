# Degree-of-Separation-C++
This project involves the creation a network from a list of data in a file and calculates the degree of separation between 
2 random person. A link is made between 2 users based on their friendship or by being located within the 
same geographical location. For instance, if Rose Gallenger is a close contact of Holly Green, and 
Holly Green is a close contact of Ojay Donaldson, and Ojay Donaldson is a close contact of Gina Kingston, 
then there are three (3) degrees of separation between Rose Gallenger and Gina Kingston. In relation 
to geographical llocations, two users are said to be from the same  location if they both share one 
of all of the following: school, work or community. These person are clasiffied as close friends.
<br>The following operation can be done with regards to the network created from the file data:
- Read and display user's data
- Update a user's information and activities in both the network and files
- Delete a user from both the network and the files.
- Suggest activities of the user's friends/close friends to the current user.
- Find and display the any link and degree of seperation between the current user and any random user that exists in the network. 


## Getting Started

You are reuired have a suitble c/c++ compiler installed on your machine or an 
Integrated Development Environment that has it's own built in C/C++ compiler
in order to compile and run this code. You can compile and run this software 
using a suitable IDE, Texteditor or the command
line to be able to compile and run a C++ program on your machine.
Compileres:
- MINGW C/C++ Compiler
- C/GCC Compiler for Windows

Reommended IDEs:
- Visual Studio 2022
- Code Blocks IDE
- DEV-C IDE
- Eclipse IDE for C++ Developement

Text Editors:
- Atom Text Editor
- NotePad++

Once you have an environment in which you can compile and run a c++ program you should have no problem with testing
as there are no dependecies required that you would need to source ouside of the c/c++ library.
